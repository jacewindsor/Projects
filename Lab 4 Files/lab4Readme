This project required the development of a database for a grocery store via a singly linked list in C.

There were many requirements imposed by the instructor, including a 10 line limit (for most cases) on functions, file splitting, no global variables, etc.
Some common practices in industry (e.g. checking if a malloc was successfull) were not required and would stress the 10 line limit, so I opted to forego these
in this instance.

The program parses an inventory file and stores the information. 12 options are given for the user to manipulate the database and retrieve information about it.
A Makefile is included for the compilation of the project.
